# dotfiles

Dotfiles are the threads that hold the IDE together. Each tool has a configuration file - a dotfile. For the shell it's (.zshrc) for neovim it's the more modern (.config/nvim/init.vim) . 

To keep track of the dotfiles and bootstrap the enviornment we use "yet another dotfiles manager". 

## Installation

You first need to get yadm - yet another dotffile management. In OSX it's `brew
install yadm` and on Ubuntu it's `apt install yadm`.

Once you have yadm, fork this repo and then `yadm clone <fork's url>`.
It will ask you whether to run the bootstrap file. Answer yes and it'll be installed 
and configured for you.

If it fails, DON'T PANIC. 
Please copy the screen output and paste into an issue and mark it as a bug and we'll help.
